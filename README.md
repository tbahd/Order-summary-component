### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt a more stable way of centering divs and elements  using Flexbox.

```css
body{
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    flex-direction: column;
}
```

### Continued development

I'm definitely going to continue learning more about flexbox as it makes positioning divs and elements a lot more easier.
